Deep web:
The deep web constitutes of those parts of world wide websites that are not indexed by standard web-engines. The normal websites that we see using our search engine on the other hand is called “surface web”: which is accessible to everyone with the internet.  The content of the deep web is mostly hidden behind the HTTP forms and includes common uses such as web mail, online banking, private or otherwise restricted access social media pages and profiles, some web forums that require registration for viewing content, services that users pay for and which are protected by paywalls, such as video on demand and some online magazines and newspapers. The content of the deep web can be located and accessed by a direct URL or IP address but it may require a password or other security access to get past public website pages.
Dark Net:	
Darknet is an overlay network within Internet that can be acessed only with specific software, configurations or authorization and it also often uses an unique customized communication protocol. All darkners require a specific software installed or network configurations made to access them(like TOR) which can be accessed through a customised browser from VIDALIA or alternatively through a proxy confugrued to perform the same function.

Dark Web:
Encrypted content on the internet that is not indexed by any popular and conventional search engines. To access dark web, specific browsers(like TOR) are used. Sometimes this is also referred to by the name of “dark net”. Using dark web provides more privacy. Therefore dark web provides for a lot of standard web services with more secrecy, that is beneficial  for many parties.  Dark web is a smaller part of Deep web. The dark net that are used in the dark web include small “friend to friend” and “peer to peer” networks as well as larger networks such as Tor, Freenet and Riffle that are either operated by public organizations or individuals. Identities and locations of darknet users stay anonymous and cannot be tracked due to layered encryption system.

What does the dark web consist of?
The dark web is the hidden collective of internet sites only accessible by a specialized web browser. It is used for keeping internet activity anonymous and private, which can be helpful in both legal and illegal applications. While some use it to evade government censorship, it has also been known to be utilized for highly illegal activity. 
Of all the things, all websites that are present on the dark web end in .onion and they have very unintelligible addresses. This makes it tougher to track the website being accessed by a person.
A lot of websites are e-commerce, business related, and also some research articles that are unavailable on surface net. 
Dark web has illicit activities as well as it has pages that include child pornography, drug mafia and illegal procurement of banned products.

Dark Web and Deep Web comparison

The dark web and the deep web are used interchangably. The easiest way to understand the difference is that not all deep web is the dark web but all dark web is the deep web.

The deep web is simply the part of the internet that cannot be accessed by search engines. It might be password-protected or exist solely on staging servers. Accessing the deep web doesn’t require a special browser or unique protocols.

The dark web, however, can only be accessed through the Tor browser. The encrypted nature of the browser means everyone trying to access the dark web remains anonymous by default. What’s more, URLs in the dark web are starkly different from regular web addresses.

All sites on the dark web end with “.onion,” as opposed to “.com” or “.org” commonly seen on the surface web. That’s a deliberate ploy so that only browsers with specific proxies are allowed to access those sites. It’s also very difficult to remember the URLs of sites on the dark web, which is another way to maintain their anonymity.

While Tor is the most popular way of accessing dark nets, the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is another decentralized anonymizing project that deploys similar principles to Tor. Effectively a self-contained internet, I2P allows users to send emails, write blogs, and chat anonymously much like they would on the regular web.
